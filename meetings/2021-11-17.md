URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/351

* KK: Tried PR 350 but didn't feel right. Created PR 351 off PR 341 (N3 Patch) which references existing definitions.
* SC: That seems better.
* JB: 351 is definitely an improvement. Good definition in SPARQL11. Our Terminology in Solid Protocol.. triple and triple pattern would seem to be useful enough in the Terminology section. We have other definitions defined elsewhere we reference. Personally I like this a bit more but I'd be fine with 351 because it sends you to the right place.
* KK: That's what I tried in 350. But had to define IRI and bnode and literal. There are a lot of definitions we go in there. It is a balance with triple pattern in the SPARQL spec. It is not entirely easy to understand. Tried to have not quite a formal definition but that can be understood by broader audience.
* SC: That's fine. The terms are used in context of the references.
* SC: What would merging entail?
* KK: It goes into PR 346.
* SC: Close 350.
* SC: Noting group agreement to merge 351.

ACTION: KK to merge 351 and close 350.


### Describe N3 Patch
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/346

* KK: Seems to be in good shape now. Let's make sure to have all the ids right so we can hook other stuff (tests).
* SC: I will review ASAP.


### Tighten consistency requirements for resource types
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/341

* KK: Did this off a 0.9 milestone. Seems we won't be able to agree on that. I'm still taking that as today's deadline. I'd like to have legitimate tests that can point out semantic inconsistencies that could lead to social engineering hacks. That's where I'm going with this. If it is difficult to write this for normative requirements. It does change how NSS is working. CSS is close to doing this. It is NSS that is ignoring the Link headers which I think is bad in this case. So I don't know if we need to take time here or postpone this like I did to some other location/milestone..
* SC: https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/301#issuecomment-970334856
* KK: It doesn't matter what's in the spec because these are things in the wild. So, how do we constrain the spec so that the stuff in the wild don't have strange effects. It is very difficult because it tries to prevent certain attacks ??? There will  be people effected by it. The evil-path tests are designed to shake out what the server might be doing in the case of things in the wild. To help with certain misunderstanings. It is assuming that servers are not compliant and find ways where people might exploit that. The sentences you put forward,.. we can wordsmith.. I didn't interpret those as something what I've intended.
* JB: I'd be a big supportor of consistency on typing. From an interop standpoint, being able to get some baseline from the server what the resource is based on what the resource is.. what is an RDF or Non-RDF source, being a container or not through the headers is.. I think for interop, any place where you get consistency is helpful. From a implementation standpoint, having written code that determines is a bit messy or makes me concerned. Essentially telling the clients to figure out.. it is not on us from the server, I think that's going to leave clients up to making incorrect choices. Possibly different servers making different ??? I think it'd be worth to provide more explicit typing and rules around it.
* SC: ...
* KK: What I really want to achieve for example that if ... so your point JB on the side is relevant but I'm trying to go beyond that. If client thinks something is an RDF source, that data will be out there. Somebody will write an RDF source, it simply goes into the data of the resource.
* SC: ...
* KK: I originally wrote some tests and noted some of them failing. ESS, NSS, CSS are all failing in different ways. You probably would expect the architecture.
* SC: ...
* KK: If you allow types of errors that NSS is expecting certainly going to end in disaster. The client is thinking that I have this type of abstract type. It is based on the assumption that the server is making. That is putting this.. the progammer will think that they are doing something ??? and someone else will engineer an attack. That is the attack that we should prevent. Therefore it is not sufficient non-normative statements because then we can't test. We need to have normative statements.
* SC: ...
* KK: BUT, as long as you have that kind of stuff in the wild, there are bound to be cases where there's...
* KK: We can go through the tables that are there. If you can come up with normative .
